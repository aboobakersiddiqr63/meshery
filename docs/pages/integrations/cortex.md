### Overview & Features:
1. A horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant, long term Prometheus.

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for Cortex

4. 
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. Durably store data for longer than the lifetime of any single machine, and use this data for long term capacity planning.

6. Makes your PromQL queries blazin' fast through aggressive parallelization and caching.

7. Gives you a global view of Prometheus time series data that includes data in long-term storage, greatly expanding the usefulness of PromQL for analytical purposes.

8. Collaborative Infrastructure as Code

9. Collaboratively manage infrastructure with your coworkers synchronously sharing the same designs.
