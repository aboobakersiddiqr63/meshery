### Overview & Features:
1. Kubeflow the cloud-native platform for machine learning operations - pipelines, training and deployment.

2. Collaborative and visual infrastructure as code for Kubeflow

4. 
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.



    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in MeshMap. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.



5. Make deployments of machine learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable. 

6. Design and manage you the machine learning toolkit for Kubernetes

7. Easy, repeatable, portable deployments on a diverse infrastructure (for example, experimenting on a laptop, then moving to an on-premises cluster or to the cloud)

8. Collaborative Infrastructure as Code

9. Collaboratively manage infrastructure with your coworkers synchronously sharing the same designs.
